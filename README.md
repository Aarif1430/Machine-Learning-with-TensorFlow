# Machine-Learning-with-TensorFlow
Advanced Machine Learning with TensorFlow. Includes Deep Learning, Classifier using TensorFlow, TensorFlow Tool Box.

# Intrducing Deep Learning
Machine Learning uses number of techniques including decision trees, SVM's and Artifical Neural networks.
Deep Learning is a new techinique which uses Artifical Neural networks and uses many hidden layers, The hidden 
layers include many neurons wired like neurons inside our brain.

# Platforms for Deep Learning
1. Google TensorFlow, See the (https://www.tensorflow.org/)
2. Theano, See the (http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)
3. Microsoft CNTK, See the (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/)
