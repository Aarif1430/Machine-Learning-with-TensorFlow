# Intrducing Deep Learning
Machine Learning uses number of techniques including decision trees, SVM's and Artifical Neural networks.
Deep Learning is a new techinique which uses Artifical Neural networks and uses many hidden layers, The hidden 
layers include many neurons wired like neurons inside our brain.
